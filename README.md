<h1> Welcome! this is a small project which implements a 3D boid simulation </h1>

<h3>What are boids?</h3> <br>
A boid (or birdoid object) on its own, is uninteresting. A group of boids, on the other hand, will simulate the flocking patterns of birds (which is very cool)<br>

This happens because of 3 simple rules which govern how boids interact: Seperation, Alignment and Cohesion <br>
You can find more detailed information [here!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) or [here!](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/labs/s2021/Boids/Boids.html)

<h3> How to run: </h3>
It is recommended that you download the project files and build it yourself using Visual Studio 22 <br>
Alternatively, there is a downloadable .exe file provided although it might be flagged by your well-meaning antivirus buddy

<h3> Controls: </h3>
WASD to move <br>
Mouse to adjust camera <br>
Hold shift to speed up movement
